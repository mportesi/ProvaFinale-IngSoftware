# Project Template - Prova Finale (Ingegneria del Software)

Project of: Sara Pid√≤ (Laureanda), Chiara Plizzari(Laureanda), Matteo Portesi
To start the server: run class "Server"
To start client from Command Line: run class "Client"
To start client from GUI: run class "Gui"

We collaborated mainly all together to the model (often the commits were made from the same pc), then Matteo managed the permanent effects and Chiara and Sara the Gui.
As far as the part of connection, Matteo managed the Socket and Chiara and Sara RMI.
